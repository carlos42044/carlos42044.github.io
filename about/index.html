			<p class="text_content">
			My name is Carlos Flores,

			I love to code and really enjoy working on projects in my spare time. I also enjoy learning about new technologiess and programming languages in my spare time. The world  of computers is fascinating and my hope is to learn as much as possible.
			</p>

			<p><span class="sub_header">Background</span></p>
			<p class="text_content">
			I recieved an Associates degree in early childhood education, and was on track to graduate with a Bachelor's in Special Education Early Childhood. However, in the fall of 2015 I helped to create a suite of interactive learning games and speech communication boards for pre-k children with special needs. After creating those games and seeing how happy the children were playing with the games I made, I was hooked.
			</p>
			<p class="text_content">During fall I looked in to programming on my own time and bought an intro to java book. I spent about a month going through the book and doing excercises. I really enjoyed learning how to program simple things and I wanted to learn more. I had never really felt this sort of passion for learning something before. I knew at that point that I wanted to become a programmer.
